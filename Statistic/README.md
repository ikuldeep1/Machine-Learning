# Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is a nonparametric test used to compare a sample distribution with a reference probability distribution (one-sample K-S test) or to compare two sample distributions (two-sample K-S test). It measures the maximum distance between the empirical distribution function of the sample and the cumulative distribution function of the reference distribution, or between the empirical distribution functions of two samples.

## Numerical Example

Let's consider a one-sample K-S test to see if a given sample comes from a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).

### Sample Data
Suppose we have the following sample data:
